# Face-Generation
The project dealt with creating new faces based on the dataset of celebrity faces using DCGAN. In this project I used a Deep Convolutional Network to create a generator that can create fake images that are as good as real images.
This project was part of Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree course. 

Files Included:
* dlnd_face_generation - File containing all the code for creating and visualizing fake images from generator
* problem_unittests.py - File containing unit tests to test discriminator and generator
